# Music Genre Classification with Deep Embeddings

This project focuses on classifying music genres using deep learning models. The goal is to utilize audio embeddings from deep neural networks to categorize songs into predefined genres. This is a typical task in music information retrieval (MIR) where the model learns to recognize patterns in audio data that correspond to specific musical genres.
